Welcome to my data analytics portfolio! This repository contains a curated selection of projects that demonstrate my skills in data analysis, visualization, and interpretation using Python and related tools. These projects I worked on while receiving my certificate in Data Analytics. The baseball project was when I was finishing up my degree in Data Analytics.
